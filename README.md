C-to-D-Wave
===========

Description
-----------

This program compiles C programs, written using a very small subset of C, to a form suitable for running on a D-Wave quantum annealer by translating through Verilog to D-Wave APIs.

Status
------

The code is still pre-alpha and should therefore be considered unfit for human consumption.
